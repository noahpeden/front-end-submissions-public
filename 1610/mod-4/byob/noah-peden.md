## Completion

### Were you able to complete all 17 endpoints? If not how many did you complete?
I completed 15 endpoints, I'd like to make two endpoints targeting tuition fees and maybe languages? Or how many universities are in a specific ountry.

### Were you able to complete all 31 endpoint tests?

No I have 15 passing tests, but they do test sad paths and most of my core functionality.

### Why were you proud of this piece of code?
Reason you are proud of code

I'm proud of this because one of the biggest delays for me was migrating my data from a tsv and getting all the tables into one migration file was a big step.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about

[Link to bad code](https://github.com/noahpeden/byob/blob/master/server.js#L77)

### Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
Reason you don't feel awesome about this code.

It took me way too long to figure out that endpoints needed to be specific and that my freakin data was capitalized.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
